# BONELAB Fusion Release
A multiplayer mod for BONELAB featuring support for Oculus and SteamVR.
This is currently only for PCVR platforms.
## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Steam, but the networking system can be swapped out using a Networking Layer.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to addon and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.

## Marrow SDK Integration
NOTICE:
When using the integration, if you have the extended sdk installed, delete the "MarrowSDK" script that comes with the extended sdk.
It can be found in "Scripts/SLZ.Marrow.SDK/SLZ/Marrow/MarrowSDK".
The reason for this is that this is already included in the real sdk, and Fusion uses some values from it, causing it to get confused.

You can download the integration unity package from the Releases tab of this repository.
Alternatively, you can download the files raw at this link:
